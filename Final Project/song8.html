            <br>English:</br>
            <br>Chorus:</br>
            <br>
                Now, let worry fall away
                No fear allowed to stay
                My dream is now your wish and my hope never ending
                When clouds build up inside
                My song can clear the sky
                Everything is alright
                "I'm invincible"
            </br>
            <br>Verse 1:</br>
            <br>
                My voice carries birds in flight
                With every note, they go higher and higher
                See how I move with such grace
                Just like a dancer on the stage
                Your voice carries life within
                Calls me to action again and again
                If you're hurt and you need me
                I'll always be there, I swear
            </br>
            <br>Pre-Chorus:</br>
            <br>
                I'll always protect you
                We'll have the chanc–µ to go to brand new heights
                You and I, unstoppable wh–µn we're together We can have it all
                A fire burns within our hearts
            </br>
            <br>Chorus:</br>
            <br>
                Now, let us go hand in hand
                To a light that lies ahead
                All of our hopes and dreams
                Can bring happiness when we're in sync
                Ah, I've always felt this warmth from you
                No one gives affection like you do
                When you're here by my side
                "I'm invincible"
            </br>
            <br>Verse 2:</br>
            <br>
                Though this path has twists and turns
                If I can walk it, there's so much I'll learn
                I know it's the long way round
                But there's no way I'm backing out now
            </br>
            <br>Pre-Chorus:</br>
            <br>
                See all my flowers? I'll tend to each one
                Don't care if I feel just a bit overcome
                We're obliged to do everything we want
                Or fester inside
                Don't let this moment die
                We've got to try!
            </br>
            <br>Bridge:</br>
            <br>
                Soon we will see a brand new era dawn
                The day will come
                The world is waiting for someone
                To change the way it's done
                We keep repeating our mistakes
                The cycle's got to break
                It's time to work through all the pain
                And be the ones to change
                Let's reach as high as we can go        
            </br>
            <br>Chorus:</br>
            <br>
                Now, has worry gone away
                And fears all been assuaged?
                My feelings may be strong
                But there's power when you have passion
                When fog builds up inside
                My song can clear your mind
                Everything will be alright
                "I'm invincible"        
            </br>

            <br>
                Now let us go hand in hand
                To a light that lies ahead
                Your wish is now my dream and my hope never ending
                Even your weakness is unique
                There's no one else like you, you're what we need
                Shine a light into the dark and be a beacon
                Love, the feeling that I get
                Every time I think of it
                The dream that I once had
                Still beats strongly in my heart
                Say it once again, say it once again and again
                "I'm invincible"
                "you're invincible"
