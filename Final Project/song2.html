    <p><strong>Lyrics:</strong>
    <br>
        'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
        I'm gonna give you my heart
        'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
        'Cause you light up the path
    </br>
    <br>
        I don't care, go on and tear me apart
        I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
        'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
        I think I saw you
    </br>
    <br>
        'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
        I wanna die in your arms, oh, oh-oh
        'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
        I'm gonna give you my heart, oh
    </br>
    <br>
        I don't care, go on and tear me apart
        I don't care if you do, ooh-ooh, ooh
        'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
        I think I see you
        I think I see you
    </br>
    <br>
        'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
        Such a heavenly view
        You're such a heavenly view
        Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
    </br>
