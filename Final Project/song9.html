            <p><strong>Lyrics:</strong>
            <br>English:</br>
            <br>Verse 1:</br>
            <br>
                I recall that day we played together by the sea
                Just you and me
                Still that scent of ocean seems to fade each passing day
                It slips away
                So I sing an old familiar song, I hope you know the one
                I will sing to call you back to me
            </br>
            <br>Chorus:</br>
            <br>
                I need you to hear it, need you to believe in
                Something out there beyond the open sea, out in the starlight
                I need you to hear it, need you to believe it
                There's a wind stirring my wings that is always beckoning
                Calling me above into the open sky
            </br>
            <br>Verse 2:</br>
            <br>
                I recall a smile, unshakeable and self-assured
                Invincible
                Now it hides behind the breaking waves upon the shore
                Yet I see more
                I know every word and every note, I'd never forget it
                Because I know it came from you
            </br>
            <br>Chorus:</br>
            <br>
                Tried my best to hear it, trying to believe in
                You and me having one final goodbye, I'll see you waving
                Trying to believe it, I want to believe it
                That your song is now my song, through your voice I'll carry on
                And one day we'll fly, you and I in the open sky
                I need you to hear it, need you to believe in
                Something out there beyond the open sea, out in the starlight
                Trying to believe it, I think I believe it
                That one day we'll meet again and continue this dreamland
                In the gleaming dawn, we'll wake up once again
            </br>
            <br>Outro:</br>
            <br>
                Trying to believe it, trying to believe in
                Something out there beyond the open sea, out in the starlight
                Trying to believe it, trying to believe it
                That one day we'll meet again and continue this dreamland
                In the gleaming dawn, we'll wake up
                Once again

            <br>Verse 1:</br>
            <br>
                Doushite ano hi asonda umi no nioi wa
                Doushite sugiru kisetsu ni kiete shimau no
                Mata onnaji uta wo utau tabi

                Ano hoshiakari wo umi no hirosa wo
                Shinjirareru? Shinjirareru kai?
                Asa wo matsu kono hane ni fuku
                Oikaze no izanau sora wo

                Shinjite miru, shinjite mirunda
                Kono uta wa watashi no uta to
                Yagate au kimi no yobu koe to
                Shinjirareru? Shinjirareru?
                Ano hoshiakari wo umi no hirosa wo
                Shinjite miru, shinjirareru
