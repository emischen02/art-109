      <p><strong>Lyrics:</strong>
        <br>Elsa:</br>
        <br>
            Every inch of me is trembling
            But not from the cold
            Something is familiar
            Like a dream I‚ÄÖcan‚ÄÖreach but not‚ÄÖquite hold
            I can sense you there
            Like‚ÄÖa friend I've always known
            I'm arriving
            And it feels like I am home
        </br>
        <br>
            I have always been a fortress
            Cold secrets deep inside
            You have secrets too
            But you don't have to hide
        </br>
        <br>
            Show yourself, I'm dying to meet you
            Show yourself, it's your turn
            Are you the one I've been looking for all of my life?
            Show yourself, I'm ready to learn
            Ah-ah, ah-ah
        </br>
        <br>Siren:</br>
        <br>
            Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
        </br>
        <br>Elsa:</br>
        <br>
            I've never felt so certain
            All my life, I've been torn
            But I'm here for a reason
            Could it be the reason I was born?
        </br>
        <br>
            I have always been so different
            Normal rules did not apply
            Is this the day? Are you the way
            I finally find out why?
        </br>
        <br>
            Show yourself, I'm no longer trembling
            Here I am, I've come so far
            You are the answer I've waited for all of my life
            Oh, show yourself, let me see who you are        
        </br>
        <br>
            Come to me now
            Open your door
            Don't make me wait
            One moment more
            Oh, come to me now
            Open your door
            Don't make me wait
            One moment more        
        </br>
        <br>Choir & Siren:</br>
        <br>
            Where the north wind meets the sea (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
            There's a river (Ah-ah, ah-ah) full of memory (Memory, memory)       
        </br> 
        <br>Iduna:</br>
        <br>
            Come, my darling, homeward bound     
        </br> 
        <br>Elsa:</br>
        <br>
            I am found     
        </br>
        <br>Elsa and Iduna:</br>
        <br>
            Show yourself, step into your power
            Grow yourself into something new    
        </br>
        <br>Iduna:</br>
        <br>
            You are the one you've been waiting for   
        </br>
        <br>Elsa & Siren:</br>
        <br>
            All of my life (All of your life)   
        </br>
        <br>Elsa:</br>
        <br>
            Oh, show yourself  
        </br>
        <br>Elsa & Siren:</br>
        <br>
            You, ah-ah, ah-ah (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
            Ah-ah, ah-ah (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
            Ah-ah, ah-ah  
        </br>
