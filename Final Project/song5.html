      <p><strong>Lyrics:</strong>
        <br>Intro:</br>
        <br>
            (High, high hopes)
        </br>
        <br>Chorus:</br>
        <br>
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living
            Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
            Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision
            Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living
            Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
            I was gonna be that one in a million
            Always had high, high hopes
        </br>
        <br>Verse 1:</br>
        <br>
            Mama said, "Fulfill the prophecy
            Be something greater, go make a legacy
            Manifest destiny back in the days
            We wanted everything, wanted everything"
            Mama said, "Burn your biographies
            Rewrite your history, light up your wildest dreams
            Museum victories every day
            We wanted everything, wanted everything"
        </br>
        <br>Pre-Chorus:</br>
        <br>
            Mama said, "Don't give up, it's a little complicated
            All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting"
        </br>
        <br>Chorus:</br>
        <br>
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living
            Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
            Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision
            Always had high, high hopes
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living
            Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
            I was gonna be that one in a million
            Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
        </br>
        <br>Verse 2:</br>
        <br>
            Mama said, "It's uphill for oddities
            The stranger crusaders ain't ever wannabes
            The weird and the novelties don't ever change
            We wanted everything, wanted everything" (High, high hopes)
            "Stay up on that rise
            Stay up on that rise and never come down, oh
            Stay up on that rise
            Stay up on that rise and never come down"
        </br>
        <br>Pre-Chorus:</br>
        <br>
            Mama said, "Don't give up, it's a little complicated
            All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
            They say it's all been done, but they haven't seen the best of me-eh-eh-eh
            So I got one more run and it's gonna be a sight to see-eh-eh-eh"
        </br>
        <br>Chorus:</br>
        <br>
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living
            Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
            Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision
            Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living
            Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
            I was gonna be that one in a million
            Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living
            Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
            Didn't have a dime, but I always had a vision
            Always had high, high hopes
            Had to have high, high hopes for a living
            Didn't know how, but I always had a feeling
            I was gonna be that one in a million
            Always had high, high hopes (High, high hopes)
