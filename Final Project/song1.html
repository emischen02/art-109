      <p><strong>Lyrics:</strong>
        <br>
            You know the bed feels warmer
            Sleeping here alone (sleeping here alone)
            You know I dream in color
            And do the things I want (do the things I want)
        </br>
        <br>
            You think you got the best of me
            Think you've had the last laugh
            Bet you think that everything good is gone
            Think you left me broken down
            Think that I'll come running back
            Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong
        </br>
        <br>
            What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
            Stand a little taller
            Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
            What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
            Footsteps even lighter
            Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
        </br>
        <br>
            What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
            Just me, myself, and I
            What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
            Stand a little taller
            Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
        </br>
        <br>
            You heard that I was starting over with someone new
            They told you I was moving on and over you
            You didn't think that I'd come back
            I'd come back swinging
            You tried to break me, but you see
        </br>
        <br>
            What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
            Stand a little taller
            Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
            What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
            Footsteps even lighter
            Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
        </br>
        <br>
            What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
            Just me, myself, and I
            What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
            Stand a little taller
            Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
        </br>
        <br>
            Thanks to you, I got a new thing started
            Thanks to you, I'm not the broken-hearted
            Thanks to you I'm finally thinking 'bout me
            You know in the end, the day you left was just my beginning
            In the end
        </br> 
        <br> 
            What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
            Stand a little taller
            Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
            What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
            Footsteps even lighter
            Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
        </br> 
        <br>
            What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
            Just me, myself, and I
            What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
            Stand a little taller
            Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone (what doesn't kill you)
        </br>
        <br>
            What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
            Just me, myself, and I (what doesn't kill you)
            What doesn't kill you makes you stronger (stronger)
            Stand a little taller (taller)
            Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone (what doesn't kill you)
            When I'm alone
        </br>
