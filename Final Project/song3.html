    <p><strong>Lyrics:</strong>
    <br>
        Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
        Drifting through the wind
        Wanting to start again?
        Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
        Like a house of cards
        One blow from caving in?
    </br>
    <br>
        Do you ever feel already buried deep?
        Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
        Do you know that there's still a chance for you
        'Cause there's a spark in you
    </br>
    <br>
        You just gotta ignite the light, and let it shine
        Just own the night like the 4th of July
    </br>
    <br>
        'Cause, baby, you're a firework
        Come on, show 'em what you're worth
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
        As you shoot across the sky
    </br>
    <br>
        Baby, you're a firework
        Come on, let your colors burst
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
        You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
    </br>
    <br>
        You don't have to feel like a waste of space
        You're original, cannot be replaced
        If you only knew what the future holds
        After a hurricane comes a rainbow
    </br>
    <br>
        Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
        So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
        Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
        And when it's time, you'll know
    </br>
    <br>
        You just gotta ignite the light, and let it shine
        Just own the night like the 4th of July
    </br>
    <br>
        'Cause, baby, you're a firework
        Come on, show 'em what you're worth
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
        As you shoot across the sky
    </br>
    <br>
        Baby, you're a firework
        Come on, let your colors burst
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
        You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
    </br>
    <br>
        Boom, boom, boom
        Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
        It's always been inside of you, you, you
        And now it's time to let it through
    </br>
    <br>
        'Cause, baby, you're a firework
        Come on, show 'em what you're worth
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
        As you shoot across the sky
    </br>
    <br>
        Baby, you're a firework
        Come on, make your colors burst
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
        You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
    </br>
    <br>
        Boom, boom, boom
        Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
        Boom, boom, boom
        Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
